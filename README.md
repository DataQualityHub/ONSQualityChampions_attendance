This code writes a workbook in the DQHub Champions SharePoint folder. The workbook has
the emails of attendees to a meeting and the division they belong to. The output can 
be used for the attendee list we usually include at the end of the minutes.

Further notes and instructions on how to set it up and run it can be found in the 
ONS Quality Champions OneNote.
